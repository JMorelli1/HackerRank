## Hacker Rank Problems

This is a place for me to work through Hacker Rank problems and keep a running log of my solutions. Some solutions will be set up to 
need manual test data entered and some will have test suites. This is dependent on the difficulty 
I have manually testing as well as if I have any trouble getting edge cases to pass.
